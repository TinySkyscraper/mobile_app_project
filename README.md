# HOW TO ACCESS ANDROID PROJECT

1. When you clone this git repository, you should place the folder named Reserve (in same
directory as this file) into the AndroidStudioProjects folder that your computer
creates when you install Android Studios. I found it easy to clone the repository
into a separate directory and paste the Reserve folder into the AndroidStudioProjects
folder. 
2. After doing this, you can import the Reserve folder as a project. I imported
the project by closing any current projects, taking me to a screen where I can choose
from different projects. On this screen, there should be a three dot icon in the top
right part of this window where you can import the folder as a project.
3. After opening the project, sync the project with the gradle file, and then you should
be able to run it on your machine.




## DESCRIPTION

This is a restuarant reservation app. It is designed so that any image can be uploaded to the app to serve
as the shape of the user's restaurant. This allows users to draw their restaurant layout on any app
and then upload it to the app. Once uploaded, the user can place tables over the restaurant in any
place of their choosing and also remove any table that he/she places. Layouts (picture of the restaurant
and the tables placed over it) can be saved and then reused, even after the app has been closed. You can
only use the last layout saved. The app also allows you to add parties to a list as they enter the restaurant
and then assign any party to any table. You can see which party is at which table at any time by clicking on
the table and you can also remove parties from any table. When parties leave the restaurant, they can be
removed from the party list. The app also allows for you to go back to the first screen and change the restaurant 
layout at anytime, after which you can click again to go to the screen where you can assign parties.
